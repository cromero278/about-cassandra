				<p>Hello friends! My name is Cassandra Romero.</p>

			<div class="body">
				<p>I'm a New Mexico native (with a zia tattoo to prove it :D).
				I'm the oldest of two children and the cat mom to a giant, she-tiger named Bagheera.</p>

				<p>Professionally, I trained with ninjas in the caverns of Mt. Fuji.
				I initially fell in love with the katana, but soon learned that I would need to focus on new technologies,
				such as the throwing star, nunchucks, and <em>chopsticks!</em>
				I now find myself in this challenging bootcamp, where I hope to hone my special set of skills.</p>

				<p>When I'm not training, I enjoy spending time relaxing with my other hobbies. I'm an avid culinary artist
					and have recently started competing on the hit reality series, Hell's Kitchen! I love to cook and eat!</p>
