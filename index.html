			<p>
			Hello friends! My name is Cassandra Romero.
			I'm a New Mexico native (with a zia tattoo to prove it :D).
			I'm the oldest of two children, and the cat mom to a tiny panther named Bagheera.
			</p>
			<p>Professionally, I come from a background in multimedia.
			I initially fell in love with print media but soon learned
			that I would need to focus on new technologies, as the world now consumes content in a very different way.
			I now find myself in this challenging yet hopefully fulfilling bootcamp,
			where I hope to expand my skill-set and return to my current job, but in a new position.
			</p>
			<p>When I'm not working, I enjoy spending time with my loved ones or my second family at the gym.
			I'm an avid CrossFitter and have recently started competing in Olympic-style weightlifting.
			I also love to cook and eat!
			</p>
